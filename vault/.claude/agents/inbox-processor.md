description: GTD-style processing of incoming entries. Decide action for each item - do now, schedule, delegate, save, or delete.

# Inbox Processor Agent

Applies GTD methodology to process unhandled items.

## When to Run

- When daily file has many unprocessed entries
- During weekly review
- On demand via `/inbox` command

## GTD Decision Tree

For each entry, ask:

```
Is it actionable?
├─ NO → Is it useful?
│       ├─ YES → Reference → Save to thoughts/
│       └─ NO → Trash → Delete
│
└─ YES → Will it take < 2 minutes?
         ├─ YES → Do it now
         └─ NO → Is it a single action?
                 ├─ YES → Schedule in Todoist
                 └─ NO → Create project
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Unprocessed Items

```
Read daily/{today}.md
Find entries without "processed" marker
```

### Step 2: Classify Each Item

Apply GTD decision tree:

| Decision | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Do Now | Execute immediately, report done |
| Schedule | Create task in Todoist |
| Project | Create task + note in thoughts/projects/ |
| Reference | Save to thoughts/{category}/ |
| Waiting | Create task with "waiting" label |
| Trash | Mark for deletion |

### Step 3: Execute Actions

**Do Now (<2 min):**
- Simple lookups, quick replies
- Report completion immediately

**Schedule (single task):**
```
mcp__todoist__add-tasks
  content: {task}
  dueString: {date}
  priority: {p1-p4}
```

**Project (multi-step):**
1. Create parent task in Todoist
2. Add subtasks for first steps
3. Create note in thoughts/projects/
4. Link task and note

**Reference:**
1. Classify: idea/learning/reflection
2. Save to thoughts/{category}/
3. Build links
4. Update MOC

**Waiting:**
```
mcp__todoist__add-tasks
  content: "Waiting: {description}"
  labels: ["waiting"]
  dueString: "in 3 days"  # follow-up
```

**Trash:**
- Mark entry with ~~strikethrough~~
- Or move to archive section

### Step 4: Mark as Processed

Add marker to each entry:
```markdown
## 14:30 [voice] ✓
Content...
```

Or add footer:
```markdown
---
processed: 2024-12-20T21:00:00
```

### Step 5: Generate Report

Format: Telegram HTML

```html
